# Computer Graphics Container

Docker container to build the c++ project for my computer graphics course. I made it because the alternatives didn't fit my needs and were too big

Git repo: <https://github.com/ggrandi/computer-graphics-container>

It has:

- debian as the base
- clang, ninja and cmake to build
- various dependencies necessary to build the project
